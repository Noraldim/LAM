  <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>Hi, I am Noradim computer engineering student who loves could computing stuff I built some interesting stuff like chatBot and created a nextCloud server, im also have an interest in Linux.
some of the work that I mentioned above and others are documented in my blog so you can check it to understand what I did.t!.</p>
<h2 id="tool-that-i-use">Tool That I Use.</h2>
<p>I have used Python to create some fun games using pygame and that knowledge develops to use Panda and the world of data analysis.
I also USE postgres SQL and mongo dp to create a Bot and trained from my personal chatLogs and other metadata to give an answer as I give.
love to use vim it makes creating projects and modifying them more essayer so I use it as my main text editor.
im also interested in networking and playing with IP, creating local labs and local servers this network-loving introduces me to cloud computing and shows me that there is a bigger world to discover.</p>
<h2 id="why-linux">why Linux?</h2>
<p>when i talk about Linux and cloud computing it may seem there is no relation between them but the link between them is very strong.
Most cloud computing services are running their services and OS to manage these servers and the most common one is Linux LIKE &lsquo;ubuntu LTS server&rsquo; because it&rsquo;s known as a suitable OS.</p>
